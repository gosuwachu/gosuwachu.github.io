<p>Hello, last week I have been in London to help our client integrate our components of Android operating system. Here is bunch of photos if you would like to see how we spent time :)</p>

<p>From this point I can say that I have became <strong>mobileÂ system developer</strong> :) It is new, exciting experience. I am looking forward to continue my work in this area. Stay tuned for posts about mobile systems development.</p>
