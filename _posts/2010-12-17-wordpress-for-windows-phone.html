<p>More good apps are coming lately for Windows Phone, like (finally) native YouTube client, and Wordpress client, from which I am writing this post :)</p>
<p>Lets do short update what happened lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great application for Android has been released - it is called <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/mobiletab/pl.androiddev.mobiletab">MobileTab</a>, and allows you to browse phone's content on a PC, all you need is a web browser.</li>
<li>My Windows Phone translator has been submitted to certification. It features translation between more than 50 languages and has built-in game that helps you with learning. Stay tuned, I will definitely post something when the application will be released.</li>
<li>These are my last days in London, I am going back to Poland on 23th December. What can I say... I will miss it, hope to visit in again for few months in the summer, will see.</li>
<li>Damian started his blog: <a href="http://www.androiddev.pl/">http://www.androiddev.pl/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Posted from WordPress for Windows Phone</p>
