<p>I have decided to switch language of my site to English. I am aware that I can make some glaring errors, but without practise it would never get better. So forgive me and if you have suggestions please write your comment, and do not hesitate to correct me when I will make mistake.<br />
Reasons why I take this decision are obvious. Every programmer should know English almost as good as his native language, because most web pages or documentations is written in English. Practising English will also bring many benefits to quality of work, it will involve better communication with clients and more freedom in speaking what I mean. I also want to widen audience which can read this site. Programming is rather exotic, and sites like this never have big audience, so there is no reason why I should still write in Polish to make it even smaller.</p>
<p>I hope you will like changes that will come to this site in the coming weeks, because I intend to rebuild it a little bit and add more content, like descriptions of projects I have worked on, more screen shots, more links, more posts - generally more everything.</p>
