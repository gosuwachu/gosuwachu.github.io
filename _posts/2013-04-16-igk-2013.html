It was 10th anniversary so even that I had to take morning flight, and then another one to be back at work on Monday morning, it was worth it. I can't say much about presentation that took place during the conference as I came at the end of second day, but I have started with my team (Kamil "ayufan" Trzciński, Konrad "Rodrigo" Rodzik, Jarek "agent_j" Pelczar) in 8h game programming contest "Compo" and it was awesome!</p>

<p>This year, twelve teams joined the competition, producing in 8h all kinds of crazy games. Our game took 2nd place, we made top-down "tank vs tank" with multiplayer up to 4 players, with tanks controlled from a smartphone. The source code can be downloaded from bitbucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gosuwachu/igk-2013/src">https://bitbucket.org/gosuwachu/igk-2013/src</a>. As always time was short, but we managed to do everything that we planned and even a little bit more. Game was written in C++ and cocos2d-x.</p>
<p>I just want to congratulate to all the teams that started this year, and I hope that we will meet again next year!</p>
